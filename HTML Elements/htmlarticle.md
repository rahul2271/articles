# Type of Element

> For the default display and styling purpose in HTML, all the elements are divided into two categories:
> 
> * Block-level element
>     
> * Inline element
>     

## Block-level element:

> These are the elements, which structure the main part of a web page, by dividing a page into coherent blocks.
> 
> A block-level element always starts with a new line and takes the full width of a web page, from left to right.
> 
> These elements can contain block-level as well as inline elements.

### Following are the block-level elements in HTML.

## Inline elements:

> Inline elements are those elements, which differentiate the part of a given text and provide it with a particular function.  
> These elements do not start with a new line and take width as per requirement.  
> The Inline elements are mostly used with other elements.
